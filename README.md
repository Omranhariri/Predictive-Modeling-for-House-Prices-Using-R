# Predictive-Modeling-for-House-Prices-Using-R

**Predictive Modeling for House Prices Using R**  
Developed a data-driven solution to predict house prices using R. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including duplicate detection, outlier removal, and descriptive statistics, to ensure data quality. A multiple linear regression model was built and optimized, with assumptions like multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, and normality validated. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as adjusted R-squared, MAPE, MAE, and RMSE, providing reliable and actionable insights for accurate price prediction.
